Policies
=======================================

Legal
---------------------------------------

You must not violate any law or the rights of any individual or entity, and must not expose Atooma or Atooma users to harm or legal liability as determined by us in our sole discretion.

Banned Content
---------------------------------------

You will not include any form of banned content in the plugin app. The following content is considered by Atooma as banned: **violence**, **intimidation**, **bullying**, **pornography**, **vulgarity**, **content violating intellectual property**, **spam**, **advertising**.

Privacy Policy
---------------------------------------

You will have a privacy policy that tells users what user data you are going to use and how you will use, display, share or transfer that data. In addition, you will include a link to your privacy policy in any app marketplace that provides you with the functionality to do so. The developers of the plugin app are held responsible for any irregular activity regarding privacy compliance.

Use Of Icons And Terms
---------------------------------------

You must not use or make derivative use of **Atooma** icons, or use terms for **Atooma** features and functionality, if such use could confuse users into thinking that there is a formal agreement between Atooma and the third party developers, or that the plugin has been developed with an active contribution from Atooma itself.

Resources
---------------------------------------

The developers will find in the SDK a default set of **.png** icons (**128x128**) for the creation of the plugin, BUT we strongly promote the creation of customized icons (same format) for the modules included in the plugin.

Also, the developers have to send to Atooma **before the launch** the same icons involved in the plugin for a proper setup of our server-side Atooma rules publishing system.

Any plugin that skips this passage will be subject to the blacklist. (read below: :ref:`policies-blacklist`)

Launch Of The Plugin App
---------------------------------------

Atooma is willing to help developers launching their plugins: for a proper setup of communication before the launch, the developers have to send to Atooma (:email:`developers@atooma.com`) the following contents:

* The plugin app **.apk**

* Graphic content of their choice such as screenshots or logos

* A text description of the plugin, possibly including any triggers and actions involved

It is very much appreciated that the aforementioned content is sent **at least a week before the launch of the plugin app**. In this case it will be our pleasure to introduce the new plugin to our community. Atooma however reserves the right to NOT give this communication support to any of the third party plugins.

Lastly, the Plugin, when submitted to the store, have to be named accordingly to the following formula: **[Plugin Name] for Atooma or [Plugin Name] Plugin for Atooma**.

.. _policies-blacklist:

Blacklist
---------------------------------------

Atooma reserves the right to request the removal from the store of any created (or derivated) plugin app that violates the previous policies. To underline **Atooma**â€™s distance from any violation of the aforementioned terms, we reserves also the right to redact and publish a **Blacklist** reporting all the plugins that violated/insist on violating the policies of use, clearly discouraging their use.
